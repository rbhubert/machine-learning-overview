Projects for the 2022 Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass. 

### [Cleaning Ames_Housing_Data dataset](cleaning%20Ames_Housing_Data%20dataset.ipynb) 

Exploration of the dataset that will be used later in the linear regression proyect. It includes the search and treatment of outliers, missing values and categorical variables.

### [Linear Regression Project](linear%20regression.ipynb) 

Creation of different regression models for the Ames_Housing_Data dataset: basic, Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet with tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. Performance analysis using MAE, RMSE and residual visualizations.

### [Logistic Regression Project](logistic%20regression.ipynb) 

Creation of a logistic regression model for the HeartDisease dataset. Performance analysis using confusion matrix and classification report (precision, recall, f1-score and support) and visualizations of precision recall and ROC curves.

### [K Nearest Neighbors Project](k-nearest%20neighbors.ipynb) 

Creation of a KNN model for the Sonar dataset using Pipeline and GridSearchCV for finding the best K hyperparameter. Performance analysis using confusion matrix and classification report.

### [Support Vector Machine Project](support%20vector%20machine.ipynb) 

Creation of a SVM model for the Wine fraud dataset using GridSearchCV for finding the best C and gamma hyperparameters. Performance analysis using confusion matrix and classification report.

### [Tree Models Project](tree_models.ipynb) 

Creation of different tree-based models for the Telco Customer Churn dataset: decision trees, random forest and adaboost. Performance analysis using confusion matrix and classification report.
