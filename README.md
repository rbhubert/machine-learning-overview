Projects for the 2022 Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass. 

### [Cleaning Ames_Housing_Data dataset](cleaning%20Ames_Housing_Data%20dataset.ipynb) 

Exploration of the dataset that will be used later in the linear regression proyect. It includes the search and treatment of outliers, missing values and categorical variables.

### [Linear Regression Project](linear%20regression.ipynb) 

Creation of different regression models for the Ames_Housing_Data dataset: basic, Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet with tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. Performance analysis using MAE, RMSE and residual visualizations.

### [Logistic Regression Project](logistic%20regression.ipynb) 

Creation of a logistic regression model for the HeartDisease dataset. Performance analysis using confusion matrix and classification report (precision, recall, f1-score and support) and visualizations of precision recall and ROC curves.
